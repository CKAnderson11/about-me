          <h2>
          Hi everyone! My name's Clara, I'm sixteen, and my pronouns are she/they. I am originally from Denver, Colorado, but I currently live in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I'm a rising junior at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School (CRLS). After highschool, I want to study pharmacology and chemical engineering. This field of study is important to me because I suffer from multiple incurable illnesses and I want to make a difference for people like me. While I think a medical degree would be a more obvious choice for me, I think I could make more of a difference creating medications for a wider range of illnesses with fewer side effects. For instance, I have gastroparesis and the only medications available to treat this condidtion commonly cause nervous system damage and a weakened immune system. I want people to not have to choose between their life and their quality of life. I joined E1T1 to gain experience that I can use to get into school and eventually to get a job in my desired field.
